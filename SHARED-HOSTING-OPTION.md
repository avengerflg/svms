### Technology Stack Changes:

- ❌ Node.js → ✅ PHP 8.x
- ❌ MongoDB → ✅ MySQL

- 100MB+ storage space

## Would you like me to create this simplified version?

The PHP version would have:

1. **Backend**: PHP with MySQL
2. **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap
3. **Database**: MySQL with simple schema
4. **Authentication**: Session-based login
5. **QR Codes**: External API integration

## Estimated Development Time:

- 2-3 days for basic functionality
- 1 week for full feature set (minus real-time features)

## Limitations:

- No real-time updates
- Basic UI (not as polished as React version)
- Limited scalability
- No advanced features like push notifications
